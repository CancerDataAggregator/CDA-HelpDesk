Cancer Data Aggregator (CDA) is designed to give you quick and easy access to metadata from multiple data centers across the National Cancer Institute (NCI) all from one standardized interface. 

## Don't know python? No problem!

In CDA, you search by common language terms, not acronyms or codes. With this simple language you can get information about the subjects, files, or specimens that you care about in a standard dataframe format (tsv) that you can open in Excel, or upload to your favorite cloud resource. By combining our [**no-installation sandbox**](./quick_start.md) with the Broad Institute FireCloud or Velsera Cancer Genomics Cloud you can find the data you need, fetch all the files, and run your favorite bioinformatics pipeline without ever leaving your web browser.

## Power users

Looking for something a bit more hands-on? A [**local install**](./install.md) of CDA-python will give you the compute you need for even the most complicated search. Take your file list to the ISB Cancer Gateway in the Cloud (ISB-CGC) to instantly access the file data for input into your own processing pipelines, locally or using their free cloud credit program to build your own custom cloud architecture.

## Developers

Are you building a metadata micro-service? Connecting even more databases? Hosting a computational resource? Whatever your use case, CDA can help. Check out our [**swagger documentation**](../documentation/api_documentation.md) to get started. Need even more data? Contact us to discuss your needs. We currently offer custom data ingest flows for ISB-CGC and are actively seeking more partners.
