## About Google Colaboratory

### What is it?

[Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index) provides small, free, on-demand computing
resources accessible through your web browser. Our colaboratory space is pre-configured to
provide all the packages you need to run cdapython, as well as example ipython
notebooks. Each time you click the button, it will start a fresh machine with no
memory of your previous changes.

### What can I do in it?

If you are familiar with python, you can freely edit the example notebook to run
different queries, or even create your own ipython notebook to run. You can also
upload code using the import feature in the bottom right pane. Keep in mind
that these instances are relatively small, so they will likely run out of memory
if you try to run a very large query. If you are working with cdapython regularly,
we recommend [installing it locally](./install.md).

### Leaving the notebook

The colab instance, any edits you've made to the code, and any results you create,
will be lost when you close your browser tab or internet connection. If you are
using the instance to run your own queries be sure to save out the results and code to
your google drive by using `File -> Save a copy in drive` before you leave.

### Doing more with cdapython

If you are working with cdapython regularly,
we recommend [installing it locally](./install.md). You'll
be able customize your installation and to run larger and more complex queries
than the colab instances can handle.
