# Installation-free CDA-python Sandbox

Try cda-python in your web browser, no installation required.

Click this button to get started: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/CancerDataAggregator/readthedocs/HEAD?labpath=docs%2FTutorials%2FWelcome.ipynb)

This will launch a Jupyter Notebook with interactive, modifiable, example notebooks ready to run.
You can preview static versions of the [example notebooks here](../Examples).

!!! note
    If you prefer to install locally please see our [Installation Guide](../Install/installation.md)

## About our MyBinder Notebook

### What is it?

[MyBinder.org](https://mybinder.org/) provides small, free, on-demand computing
resources accessible through your web browser. Our binder is pre-configured to
provide all the packages you need to run cda-python, as well as an example ipython
notebook. Each time you click the button, it will start a fresh machine with no
memory of your previous changes.

### What can I do in it?

If you are familiar with python, you can freely edit the example notebook to run
different queries, or even create your own ipython notebook to run. You can also
upload code using the import feature in the bottom right pane. Keep in mind
that MyBinder instances are relatively small, so they will likely run out of memory
if you try to run a very large query. If you are working with cda-python regularly,
we recommend [installing it locally](../Install/installation.md).

### Leaving the notebook

The binder instance, any edits you've made to the code, and any results you create,
will be lost when you close your browser tab or internet connection. If you are
using the instance to run your own queries be sure to save out the results and code to
your local computer by using the export feature in the bottom right pane before you leave.

### Doing more with cda-python

If you are working with cda-python regularly,
we recommend [installing it locally](../Install/installation.md). You'll
be able customize your installation and to run larger and more complex queries
than the binder instances can handle.
