Human research subjects are usually not traceable to a particular person to protect the subjects privacy. This entity plays the role of the case_id in existing data. A subject who participates in 3 studies will have 3 researchsubject IDs.</li>\n",
    "<li><b>specimen:</b> Any material taken as a sample from a biological entity (living or dead), or from a physical object or the environment. Specimens are usually collected as an example of their kind, often for use in some investigation.</li>\n",
    "<li><b>file:</b> A unit of data about subjects, researchsubjects, specimens, or their associated information.</li>\n",
    "<li><b>mutation:</b> Molecular data about specific mutations, currently limited to the TCGA-READ project from GDC.</li>\n",
