    "<li><b>subject:</b> A patient entity captures the study-independent metadata for research subjects. Human research subjects are usually not traceable to a particular person to protect the subjects privacy.</li>\n",
    "<li><b>researchsubject:</b> A research subject is the entity of interest in a specific research study or project, typically a human being or an animal, but can also be a device, group of humans or animals, or a tissue sample. Human research subjects are usually not traceable to a particular person to protect the subjects privacy. This entity plays the role of the case_id in existing data. A subject who participates in 3 studies will have 3 researchsubject IDs.</li>\n",
    "<li><b>specimen:</b> Any material taken as a sample from a biological entity (living or dead), or from a physical object or the environment. Specimens are usually collected as an example of their kind, often for use in some investigation.</li>\n",
    "<li><b>file:</b> A unit of data about subjects, researchsubjects, specimens, or their associated information.</li>\n",
    "<li><b>mutation:</b> Molecular data about specific mutations, currently limited to the TCGA-READ project from GDC.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",

    "<li><b>diagnosis:</b> A collection of characteristics that describe an abnormal condition of the body as assessed at a point in time. May be used to capture information about neoplastic and non-neoplastic conditions.</li>\n",
    "<li><b>treatment:</b> Represent medication administration or other treatment types.</li>\n",

    "Any metadata field can be searched from any endpoint, the only difference between search types is what type of data is returned by default.

If you want to build a cohort, but are particularly interested in studies rather than the participates per se, search by `researchsubject`. If you are looking for biosamples that can be ordered or a specific format of information (for e.g. histological slides) start with `specimen`. If you are primarily looking for files you can reuse for your own analysis, start with `file`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In CDA search, these concepts can also be chained together, so you can look specifically for specimen subjects, or researchsubject diagnoses. In the four 'main' tables, all of the rows will have one or more files associated with them that can be directly found by chaining, as in specimen files. Diagnosis and treatment do not have files directly associated with them and so can only be used to find files in conjunction with the other searches.\n",

    "  <li><b>id:</b> The 'logical' identifier of the entity in the repository, e.g. a UUID. This 'id' is unique within a given system. The identified entity may have a different 'id' in a different system.</li>\n",
    "<li><b>identifier:</b> A 'business' identifier for the entity, typically as provided by an external system or authority, that persists across implementing systems (i.e. a 'logical' identifier). Uses a specialized, complex 'Identifier' data type to capture information about the source of the business identifier - or a URI expressed as a string to an existing entity.</li>\n",
    "<li><b>identifier.system:</b> The system or namespace that defines the identifier.</li>\n",
    "<li><b>identifier.value:</b> The value of the identifier, as defined by the system.</li>\n",
    "  <li><b>primary_diagnosis:</b> The diagnosis instance that qualified a subject for inclusion on a ResearchProject.</li>\n",
    "  <li><b>age_at_diagnosis:</b> The age in days of the individual at the time of diagnosis.</li>\n",
    "  <li><b>morphology:</b> Code that represents the histology of the disease using the third edition of the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/standards/classifications/other-classifications/international-classification-of-diseases-for-oncology\">International Classification of Diseases for Oncology</a>, published in 2000, used principally in tumor and cancer registries for coding the site (topography) and the histology (morphology) of neoplasms.</li>\n",
    "  <li><b>stage:</b> The extent of a cancer in the body. Staging is usually based on the size of the tumor, whether lymph nodes contain cancer, and whether the cancer has spread from the original site to other parts of the body. Different diseases may use different staging criteria, please refer to the originating data source to see what staging system is reported</li>\n",
    "  <li><b>grade:</b> The degree of abnormality of cancer cells, a measure of differentiation, the extent to which cancer cells are similar in appearance and function to healthy cells of the same tissue type. The degree of differentiation often relates to the clinical behavior of the particular tumor. Based on the microscopic findings, tumor grade is commonly described by one of four degrees of severity. Histopathologic grade of a tumor may be used to plan treatment and estimate the future course, outcome, and overall prognosis of disease. Certain types of cancers, such as soft tissue sarcoma, primary brain tumors, lymphomas, and breast have special grading systems.</li>\n",
    "  <li><b>method_of_diagnosis:</b> The method used to confirm the patients malignant diagnosis.</li>\n",
    "  <li><b>subject_id:</b> An identifier for the subject. Can be joined to the `id` field from subject results</li>\n",
    "  <li><b>researchsubject_id:</b> An identifier for the subject. Can be joined to the `id` field from researchsubject results</li>\n",
