Human research subjects are usually not traceable to a particular person to protect the subjects privacy. This entity plays the role of the case_id in existing data. An individual who participates in 3 studies will have 3 researchsubject IDs</li>\n",

If you are looking for biosamples that can be ordered or a specfic format of information (for e.g. histological slides) start with `specimen`. If you are primarily looking for files you can reuse for your own analysis, start with `file`.\n",

In the four 'main' tables, all of the rows will have one or more files associated with them that can be directly found by chaining, as in specimen files. Diagnosis and treatment do not have files directly associated with them and so can only be used to find files in conjunction with the other searches.\n",

The degree of differentiation often relates to the clinical behavior of the particular tumor. Based on the microscopic findings, tumor grade is commonly described by one of four degrees of severity. Histopathologic grade of a tumor may be used to plan treatment and estimate the future course, outcome, and overall prognosis of disease. Certain types of cancers, such as soft tissue sarcoma, primary brain tumors, lymphomas, and breast have special grading systems.</li>\n",
